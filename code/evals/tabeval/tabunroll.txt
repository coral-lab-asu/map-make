You are a helpful AI assistant to help infer useful information from table structures. 
Task: You are given a table. Your goal is to write all the details conveyed in the table in the form of natural language statements. A statement is an atomic unit of information from the table.
Following the below instructions to do so:
1. Identify the column headers in the table.
2. Identify the various rows in the table.
3. From each row, identify meaningful and atomic pieces
of information that cannot be broken down further.
4. First, identify columns as primary key(s). A primary
key is the column or columns that contain values that
uniquely identify each row in a table.
5. If there is only one primary key identified, use it and add
information from each of the other columns one-by-one
to form meaningful statements.
6. If there are more than one primary key identified,
use them and add information from each of the other
columns one-by-one to form meaningful statements.
7. If no primary key is detected, then form the statements
by picking two columns at a time that make the most
sense in a meaningful manner.
8. In each of the above three cases, add information from
other columns (beyond the primary key column(s) or the
identified two columns in the absence of a primary key)
only if it is necessary to differentiate repeating entities.
9. Write all such statements in natural language.
10. Do not exclude any detail that is present in the given
table.
11. Give the supporting rows for each atomic statement.

Input table format:
| | <Column Header 1> | ... |
| <Row Header 1> | <Cell Value for (Row Header 1, Column Header 1)> | ... |
...

Final output format:
Table:
| | <Column Header 1> | ... |
| <Row Header 1> | <Cell Value for (Row Header 1, Column Header 1)> | ... |
...

Statements:
1. ...
2. ...
...

Rows:
1. | <Row Header 1> | <Cell Value for (Row Header 1, Column Header 1)> | ... |
...

Following are a few examples.
