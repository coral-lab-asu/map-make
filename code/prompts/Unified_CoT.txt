You are an expert at converting unstructured, detailed textual inputs into highly structured tables.
You are given 3 tasks to perform sequentially.
Perform TASK 1, then, use the output of TASK 1 to perform TASK 2. Finally, use the outputs of TASK 1 and TASK 2 to perform TASK 3. After completing all three tasks, present the outputs in the order of TASK 1, TASK 2, and TASK 3, separated clearly.


***TASK 1***: 
Decompose the given paragraphs or sentences into clear, self-contained, and highly detailed short atomic statements without losing any information. Each atomic statement should capture a single fact or action with maximum granularity.

***INSTRUCTIONS for TASK 1***:
Capture only information explicitly stated in the input text.
No detail should be assumed, inferred, or added that is not present in the text.
Each atomic statement should contain only one key entity and one action or attribute.
If a sentence contains multiple pieces of information, decompose it further into more granular statements.
Eliminate ambiguity by resolving pronouns and ensuring each statement stands alone.
Preserve necessary context so each statement is meaningful on its own.
Represent numerical data and units exactly as given in the input text.
Ensure each statement conveys unique information without overlapping others.
Ensure statements are clear, direct, and free from unnecessary complexity.
DO NOT infer or calculate additional data points, such as missed shots, unless explicitly stated in the text.
Resolve pronouns to their corresponding nouns for clarity.
Maintain relationships between entities without combining multiple facts.

***OUTPUT FORMAT for TASK 1***:
<ATOMIC STATEMENT 1>
<ATOMIC STATEMENT 2>
<ATOMIC STATEMENT 3>
...


***REASONING STEPS for TASK 1***:
For each sentence, identify the entities and their corresponding events.

**Sample Input**:

... 

Repeat **Step 1** for all sentences in **Sample Input**

Output after processing all sentences in **Sample Input** for TASK 1:
The Oklahoma City Thunder's record is 16 wins.
The Oklahoma City Thunder's record is 17 losses.
The Phoenix Suns' record is 18 wins.
The Phoenix Suns' record is 16 losses.

Kevin Durant returned to play after a six-game absence due to an ankle sprain.
Kevin Durant scored a season-high 44 points in the game.
Kevin Durant played 40 minutes during the game.

***FINAL CHECKLIST for TASK 1***:
All information from the input text is included.
No information or calculation is added that is not present in the text.
Every fact and detail is accurately represented.
Statements are clear and can be understood independently.
Numerical data and units are formatted exactly as provided in the text.
Each statement directly reflects the input text without inferred details.
Pronouns are resolved; statements are unambiguous.
Each statement contains only one key entity and one action or attribute.

Do not number the statements or add extra formatting.


***TASK 2***:
Given a set of atomic text statements, extract row and column headers to create a table schema.

***INSTRUCTIONS for TASK 2***:
Do not proceed without completing TASK 1.
Read the statements carefully to identify all attributes, entities, and data points mentioned, whether explicitly stated or implicitly implied.
Determine the row headers (primary keys) and column headers required to represent the data comprehensively and concisely:
Row headers are the unique identifiers for individual rows (key entities).
Column headers are the attributes of the primary keys that represent different aspects or data points.
Include all explicit and implicit data points, ensuring no relevant information is overlooked. 
Pay close attention to numerical data, even if it is presented within comparative statements or descriptions of events or related to specific categories or time periods mentioned in the text. 
Explicit numerical data must always be captured as attributes where appropriate. 
Implicit data points or recurring attributes must also be included.
Avoid adding actions as column headers but extract any data points associated with them.
Ensure that all numerical values are captured as attributes, even if they are related to specific time periods or events within the context. When encountering comparative statements or ratios like "X of Y", ensure you capture both 'X' and 'Y' as potentially distinct and relevant data points if they represent different aspects of an attribute.
Be attentive to granular details and avoid focusing solely on general or aggregate values if more specific data points are available in the text.

***OUTPUT FORMAT for TASK 2***:
{
    "<Table name>": {
        "row_headers": ["Row Header 1", ...],
        "column_headers": ["Column Header 1", ...]
    }
    ...
}


***REASONING STEPS for TASK 2***:
**Sample input**:
The Oklahoma City Thunder's record is 16 wins.
The Oklahoma City Thunder's record is 17 losses.
The Phoenix Suns' record is 18 wins.
The Phoenix Suns' record is 16 losses.
The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Phoenix Suns in overtime on Wednesday.
The Oklahoma City Thunder scored 137 points.
The Phoenix Suns scored 134 points.
Oklahoma City Thunder has won three of their last four games.
Kevin Durant returned to play after a six-game absence due to an ankle sprain.
Kevin Durant scored a season-high 44 points in the game.
Kevin Durant played 40 minutes during the game.

**Step 1 - Identify the context from all the statements to generate a short description**
Thought: This is a summary of a basketball game played between the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Phoenix Suns and gives all the relevant statistics about the players and the games. Every statement is either about the team or one of the players hence it would be ideal to create to separate tables for them. One table for the teams, and one for the players.

**Step 2 - Create a empty list of row and column headers for the tables. This list would be updated as we keep on processing the statements and will keep adding relevant column and row headers to the list.**
*Intermediate output*: 
{
    "Team": {
    "row_headers": [],
    "column_headers": [], 
    }
    "Player": {
        "row_headers": [],
        "col_headers": []
    }
}

**Step 3 - Process statements one by one and add relevant headers if not already present in the list.**
