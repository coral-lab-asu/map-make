Instruction: Process the given text and generate Player and Team tables.

Letâ€™s do the following tasks:
1. Extract team and player information from the following input. Please focus on the table format and extract all relevant tuples in (team or player name, attribute, value) format.
2. Integrate these tuples into two tables in the output format given below.


Illustration :
Input: The Oklahoma City Thunder (16 - 17) defeated the Phoenix Suns (18 - 16) 137 - 134 in overtime on Wednesday. Oklahoma City has won three of their last four games. Kevin Durant returned from a six - game absence due to an ankle sprain and put up a season - high 44 points in 40 minutes.

Output:
### Team
| Team | Wins | Losses | Total Points |
| Thunder | 16 | 17| None |
| Suns | 18 | None | 134 |

### Player
| Player | Points | Minutes Played |
| Kevin Durant | 44 | 40 |

**Output Format**:

### Team
| Team | <Column Header 1> | ... |
| <Row Header 1> | <Cell Value for (Row Header 1, Column Header 1)> | ... |
...

### Player
| Player | <Column Header 1> | ... |
| <Row Header 1> | <Cell Value for (Row Header 1, Column Header 1)> | ... |
...

Table name leads with a ###, followed by the table where values are separated by the symbol '|' and rows are separated by '\n'.
Use '|' as the only separator/delimiter.
Empty cell values are filled as "None".
Provide the output in the specified format only.
