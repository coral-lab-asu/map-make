Instruction: According to the live text, please count the number of events of both teams.
Note that goals and saved attempts and blocked attempts and missed attempts are considered shots. Handball and dangerous play are also considered foul. The second yellow card is also considered a red card. Penalty is also considered as free kicks.

Task:
Write valid, executable Python code that defines and runs a function `consolidate_events(event_tuples)` which:
- Accepts the list of tuples as input.
- Returns a structured dictionary (or another data structure) mapping each team (e.g., "Home Team" and "Away Team") to a count of each event.

Final Output Instructions:
- The output must be *pure Python code* with no markdown delimiters (i.e., do not include triple backticks in your output).
- Do not output any additional text or explanation.
- Ensure you call the function within the code to execute it.
- Include any necessary error handling to ensure the code executes without issues.
