You are expert at converting text to tables.

Task: Given a text description, generate and fill tables.

Think step by step and output the Team table and the Player Table.

Output format:
### Team
| Team | <Column Header 1> | ... |
| <Row Header 1> | <Cell Value for (Row Header 1, Column Header 1)> | ... |
...

### Player
| Player | <Column Header 1> | ... |
| <Row Header 1> | <Cell Value for (Row Header 1, Column Header 1)> | ... |
...


Table name leads with a ###, followed by the table where values are separated by the symbol '|' and rows are separated by '\n'.
Use '|' as the only separator/delimiter.
Empty cell values are filled as "None".

Provide the output in the specified format only.
