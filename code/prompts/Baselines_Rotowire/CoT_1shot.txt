You are expert at converting text to tables.

Task: Given a text description, generate and fill tables.

Think step by step and output the Team table and the Player Table.

Sample Illustration:
Input:
The Oklahoma City Thunder (16 - 17) defeated the Phoenix Suns (18 - 16) 137 - 134 in overtime on Wednesday. Oklahoma City has won three of their last four games. Kevin Durant returned from a six - game absence due to an ankle sprain and put up a season - high 44 points in 40 minutes.

Output:
### Team
| Team | Wins | Losses | Total Points |
| Thunder | 16 | 17| None |
| Suns | 18 | None | 134 |

### Player
| Player | Points | Minutes Played |
| Kevin Durant | 44 | 40 |


Output format:
### Team
| Team | <Column Header 1> | ... |
| <Row Header 1> | <Cell Value for (Row Header 1, Column Header 1)> | ... |
...

### Player
| Player | <Column Header 1> | ... |
| <Row Header 1> | <Cell Value for (Row Header 1, Column Header 1)> | ... |
...

Table name leads with a ###, followed by the table where values are separated by the symbol '|' and rows are separated by '\n'.
Use '|' as the only separator/delimiter.
Empty cell values are filled as "None".

Provide the output in the specified format only.
